## Course description
The goal of this course was to introduce advanced machine learning methods and show how they work in practice. Laboratory tasks addressed a variety of problems from the completely theoretical to the practical. 

In addition to the labs, the preparation of the two projects linked below was also required:

- [Project I - IRLS implementation](https://github.com/Wladeko/aml-project-1)
- [Project II - Feature selection](https://github.com/Wladeko/aml-project-2)

## Repository structure
Each folder contains different project from course program. It has `resources` subdirectory where project task is stored.

## Installation and replication of results
The projects were made through one semester on different hardware configurations. If you want to replicate the results, it is recommended to use `python 3.9` and packages listed in `requirements.txt` file.
